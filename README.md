Hello I'm troublesbrewin
I'm a new member interested in numerous technical disciplines
40 years of Audio Visual and Security system engineering from tube theory to 
digital and network based systems and now cloud and server hosted access and video surveillance.
I've dabbled in control system programming, video conference configurations, huge video walls and stadium sound systems.
But thats NOT what I'm here for... now I've fallen into the grip of RC Airplanes, Drones, and robotics.
still learning and still interested, but now I'm sharing with my grandchildren.
I reserve the right to modify these basic thoughts as I see fit.
troublesbrewin is from my beer making hobby - 
which still consumes me.
more later.
